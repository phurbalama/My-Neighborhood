    <div class="right"><h2>History</h2><p class="paragraph"> The Jackson Heights name comes from Jackson Avenue, the former name for Northern Boulevard, a major thoroughfare that bisects the neighborhood. John C. Jackson built the road across what is now Jackson Heights in 1859. The Jackson Avenue name is retained by this major road in a short stretch between Queens Plaza and Queensâ€“Midtown Tunnel in Long Island City. The place was not particularly high, but the name "heights" showed that the place was originally meant to be exclusive. Until 1916, the area was called "Trains Meadow", but contrary to the name, there were very few trains in the area. It is suspected that it was corrupted from "drain".</p></div></div>

    <div class="right"><p class="paragraph"> Jackson Heights is the home to the garden apartment building, where it first originated in the nineteen twenties. The Jackson Heights neighborhood has evolved into one of the most integrated communities in the world, comprised of residents whose families originated in Asia, Latin American, Europe and Africa. This is a brief introduction into the neighborhood housing stock. Jackson Heights is the gracious home of the garden apartment and, as we understand it, where the term originated. We had an opportunity to get a tour of one of these lifestyle-friendly buildings from Carmen Carfagna, wife of one the Jackson Heights leading realtors, Michael, and here is what we saw.</p></div></div>
