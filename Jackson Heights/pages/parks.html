    <div class="right"><h2>Travers Park</h2><p class="paragraph"> Travers Park, founded in 1948 and named in honor of Jackson Heights community leader Thomas J. Travers, was most recently renovated in 2010 and features a leaf-and-vine shaped spray shower, benches and plantings, and a bicycle rack for the Jackson Heights community to use. The Travers Park playground is fully-ADA compliant and is appropriate for children aged 5 to 10 years old, and there are also basketball courts, game tables and picnic areas, and areas for handball, tennis, and roller hockey. With its amenities, Travers Park brings the Jackson Heights community together through play equipment, athletic facilities, and attractive and well-designed plantings and horticulture.</p></div></div>

    <div class="right"><p class="paragraph"> Travers Park is a 2-acre (8,100 m2) community park and playground in Jackson Heights, Queens, New York City. It is located between 77th and 78th Streets, on the north side of 34th Avenue. More than half of the park is occupied by an asphalt play area, with basketball and tennis courts. A children's playground with leaf-and-vine shaped spray shower occupies about one third of the park. There are also restroom facilities, handball courts, a small picnic area and a bicycle rack. In 2012, a segment of adjacent 78th Street was transformed in a permanent Street Plaza and the sports area of a nearby school was bought by New York City and added to the park. Although Travers Park is surrounded by trees, it does not have a lawn or any significant green space.</p></div></div>
